## 🧠 2. Overview

This repository contains a high-resolution simulated hospital cohort for **early clinical deterioration modeling**.

Each admission is followed for up to **72 hours** from arrival, with:

- Hourly **vital signs**  
  Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO₂, temperature, oxygen support, mobility, nurse alerts.
- Hourly **laboratory values**  
  WBC, lactate, creatinine, CRP, hemoglobin, sepsis risk.
- Patient-level **context**  
  Demographics, comorbidity burden, admission type, baseline risk, and length of stay.
- Multiple **deterioration outcomes**, including a precisely defined **“next 12 hours”** prediction target.

All records are **fully simulated** and **internally consistent**  
(e.g., oxygen flow is always `0.0` when no oxygen device is used).

The dataset is designed as a **machine-learning-ready benchmark** for:

- Early warning systems (EWS) and rapid response triggers  
- Sepsis / deterioration risk modeling and score calibration  
- Time-series and sequence models (RNNs, Temporal CNNs, Transformers, temporal tabular models)  
- Teaching, prototyping, and methods research in clinical ML, without touching real-patient data

### 3.2 ⏱️ Granularity

- **Patient level**  
  - `patients.csv` — one row per patient (10,000 rows).

- **Hourly time series**  
  - `vitals_timeseries.csv` — one row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)` for vital signs.  
  - `labs_timeseries.csv` — one row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)` for lab values.  
  - `hospital_deterioration_hourly_panel.csv` — one row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)` with vitals, labs, static features, and labels.  
  - `hospital_deterioration_ml_ready.csv` — same hourly granularity, but with features + single target only.

Each patient has a length of stay between **12 and 72 hours** (`los_hours`), and the time series cover:

```text
hour_from_admission = 0, 1, 2, ..., los_hours - 1
```

## 📘 4. File descriptions

### 4.1 `patients.csv` — Patient-level static data

**One row per patient (10,000 rows).**  
Includes:

- `patient_id` — artificial identifier  
- `age`, `gender`  
- `comorbidity_index` — aggregate comorbidity burden  
- `admission_type` — ED / Elective / Transfer  
- `baseline_risk_score` — latent baseline deterioration risk (0–1)  
- `los_hours` — length of stay (12–72 hours)  
- Deterioration outcomes:

  - `deterioration_within_12h_from_admission`
  - `deterioration_hour` (or -1 if no event)

✅ **Use this for:**

- Patient-level stratification and outcome prevalence  
- Linking to hourly tables via `patient_id`.

---

### 4.2 `vitals_timeseries.csv` — Hourly vital signs

**One row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)`.**

Includes hourly:

- `heart_rate`, `respiratory_rate`  
- `spo2_pct`, `temperature_c`  
- `systolic_bp`, `diastolic_bp`  
- `oxygen_device`, `oxygen_flow`  
- `mobility_score`  
- `nurse_alert`

**Consistency note:** when `oxygen_device == "none"`, `oxygen_flow` is always `0.0`.

✅ **Use this for:**

- Pure vitals time-series modeling  
- Feature engineering on dynamic physiologic trends.

---

### 4.3 `labs_timeseries.csv` — Hourly lab values

**One row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)`.**

Includes hourly:

- `wbc_count`  
- `lactate`  
- `creatinine`  
- `crp_level`  
- `hemoglobin`  
- `sepsis_risk_score` — latent sepsis risk (0–1)

✅ **Use this for:**

- Combining vitals + labs for richer time-series models.

---

### 4.4 `hospital_deterioration_hourly_panel.csv` — Full joined hourly panel

**One row per `(patient_id, hour_from_admission)`** with:

- Hourly **vitals**  
- Hourly **labs**

- Multi-task learning  
- Advanced feature engineering without doing your own joins.

---

### 4.5 `hospital_deterioration_ml_ready.csv` — ML-ready classification table

**One row per hourly observation** (per patient and `hour_from_admission`).

This file is a clean modeling view:

- **Features only**:
  - Hourly vitals and labs
  - Static covariates at admission (`age`, `gender`, `comorbidity_index`, `admission_type`)
- **Single target**:
  - `deterioration_next_12h` (0/1)

This is the **recommended entry point** for most users.

Minimal example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("hospital_deterioration_ml_ready.csv")

X = df.drop(columns=["deterioration_next_12h"])
y = df["deterioration_next_12h"]

print(X.shape, y.mean())
```

---

## 🎯 5. Main prediction task: deterioration in the next 12 hours

For each row (one patient at a specific `hour_from_admission = t`), the binary target:

```text
deterioration_next_12h
```

is defined using the patient-level `deterioration_hour` as:

- `deterioration_next_12h = 1`  
  if a deterioration event occurs **after the current hour** and **within the next 12 hours**:

  ```text
  t < deterioration_hour ≤ t + 12
  ```

- `deterioration_next_12h = 0` otherwise, including:
  - stays with no deterioration at all, and  
  - the hour where the event is happening now.

This framing mirrors how **operational early-warning systems** are deployed: models predict risk ahead of time, providing a buffer for clinicians to intervene.

It is well-suited for:

- Early-warning models with different alert thresholds  
- Cost-sensitive optimization (balancing missed events vs false alarms)  
- Temporal evaluation (patient-level splits, rolling validation, horizon-based metrics)

## 🧪 6. Example usage

### 6.1 Load ML-ready dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

ml = pd.read_csv("hospital_deterioration_ml_ready.csv")

X = ml.drop(columns=["deterioration_next_12h"])
y = ml["deterioration_next_12h"]

print(f"Features: {X.shape}, Target positive rate: {y.mean():.3f}")
```

### 6.2 Join vitals, labs, and patients

```python
import pandas as pd

patients = pd.read_csv("patients.csv")
vitals = pd.read_csv("vitals_timeseries.csv")
labs = pd.read_csv("labs_timeseries.csv")

panel = (
    vitals
    .merge(labs, on=["patient_id", "hour_from_admission"], how="inner")
    .merge(patients, on="patient_id", how="left")
)

print(panel.shape)
```

You can also start from `hospital_deterioration_hourly_panel.csv` directly if you prefer a pre-joined view.

## 🧭 7. Suggested ML tasks & use cases

Some possible tasks:

- **Binary classification**  
  - Predict `deterioration_next_12h` using `hospital_deterioration_ml_ready.csv`.

- **Time-series and sequence modeling**  
  - Use recurrent or transformer models over the hourly series for each patient.

- **Risk score calibration and interpretability**  
  - Compare classical logistic regression, tree-based models, and deep models.  
  - Study calibration curves and feature importance (e.g., SHAP).

- **Threshold and policy optimization**  
  - Explore different alert thresholds and their impact on recall, precision, and false alarm burden.

- **Teaching and benchmarking**  
  - Demonstrate end-to-end pipelines: data loading → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation.

---

## 🔐 8. Data generation & privacy

The cohort is generated via a **high-fidelity, privacy-preserving simulation pipeline**:

- Patient profiles (age, comorbidities, admission route) determine a **baseline risk** of deterioration.  
- Vital and lab trajectories evolve over time, with **higher-risk patients drifting towards more abnormal values** as they approach deterioration.  
- Latent risk scores:
  - `baseline_risk_score` (at admission)
  - `sepsis_risk_score` (hourly)

  are derived from the same underlying factors and can be used for:

  - Risk calibration  
  - Feature importance analysis  
  - Interpretable modeling.

No row corresponds to a real individual or a specific hospital.  
The dataset is intended for **methods research**, **benchmarking**, **education**, and **prototyping** early warning systems, not for real-time clinical decision-making.

---

## ⚠️ 9. Limitations & ethical notes

- The data are **fully synthetic** and cannot be used to make clinical decisions about real patients.  
- Patterns are designed to be **plausible**, not to reproduce any specific hospital or population.  
- There are no missing values: this is a design choice to keep the benchmark clean and focused on modeling, not imputation.  
- Researchers should treat this as a **simulation benchmark**, not a substitute for real-world validation.
